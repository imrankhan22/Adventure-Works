# Adventure-Works

This project was to perform analysis for Adventure Works Bikes customer data.

It was posed during Microsoft's Principles of Machine Learning Certification and I thought it was interesting.

From the available data provided - Cutomer Information, Customer Spending and Customer Bike Buyer data. We needed to provide two things:

We need to predict if a customer will buy a bike or not given the above information.
We need to predict customer average month spend.
I explore the bike buy or not a problem in the "Classification" notebook and the average month spend in the "Regression" notebook.

Various algorithms and ensemble methods were of interest for this particular data such as: RandomForest classifier and regressor, Logistic Regression, NeuralNetworkRegressor and Ploynomial Regression. These were done in conjunction with Cross Validation for hyperparameter tuning and creative feature generation.
